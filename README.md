## Progress & Personal Notes
I haven't had a ton of time this summer to work on it with traveling and some other personal stuff going on, but I've put in a decent amount of work as of 7/9/24. I plan to finish the entire Rust Book by 7/15 (next monday), so that I have enough time to work on the web server.

## Future Ideas
I would like to do some projects based around security using Rust. Another project that I'd like to do is to potentially have a schedule/planner thingy on my website where the back end is written in Rust with certain more advanced features. I've never worked with graphics before (at least it's been a while and only JavaFX), so that's something for the future as of now.
