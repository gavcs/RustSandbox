## Future Ideas
I would like to do some projects based around security using Rust. Another project that I'd like to do is to potentially have a schedule/planner thingy on my website where the back end is written in Rust with certain more advanced features. I've never worked with graphics before (at least it's been a while and only JavaFX), so that's something for the future as of now.
